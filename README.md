# Mazes

## Overview
This team project was created as part of a game jam that we in the WCC Programming Club put on. It took place on June 6th, 2025 and we completed it in about 6 hours.

The game itself is comprised of a menu screen and (so far) one maze level. The user chooses a character and attempts to reach the end of the maze. Once that is accomplished the game cycles back to the start screen. We have a couple participants working on additional levels after the fact and we may merge them in later as finished.
